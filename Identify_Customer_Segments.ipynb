    "# Project: Identify Customer Segments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will help you complete this task by providing a framework within which you will perform your analysis steps. In each step of the project, you will see some text describing the subtask that you will perform, followed by one or more code cells for you to complete your work. **Feel free to add additional code and markdown cells as you go along so that you can explore everything in precise chunks.** The code cells provided in the base template will outline only the major tasks, and will usually not be enough to cover all of the minor tasks that comprise it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that while there will be precise guidelines on how you should handle certain tasks in the project, there will also be places where an exact specification is not provided. **There will be times in the project where you will need to make and justify your own decisions on how to treat the data.** These are places where there may not be only one way to handle the data. In real-life tasks, there may be many valid ways to approach an analysis task. One of the most important things you can do is clearly document your approach so that other scientists can understand the decisions you've made.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of most sections, there will be a Markdown cell labeled **Discussion**. In these cells, you will report your findings for the completed section, as well as document the decisions that you made in your approach to each subtask. **Your project will be evaluated not just on the code used to complete the tasks outlined, but also your communication about your observations and conclusions at each stage.**"

    "### Step 0: Load the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four files associated with this project (not including this one):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv`: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv`: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Data_Dictionary.md`: Detailed information file about the features in the provided datasets.\n",
    "- `AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv`: Summary of feature attributes for demographics data; 85 features (rows) x 4 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of the demographics files represents a single person, but also includes information outside of individuals, including information about their household, building, and neighborhood. You will use this information to cluster the general population into groups with similar demographic properties. Then, you will see how the people in the customers dataset fit into those created clusters. The hope here is that certain clusters are over-represented in the customers data, as compared to the general population; those over-represented clusters will be assumed to be part of the core userbase. This information can then be used for further applications, such as targeting for a marketing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off with, load in the demographics data for the general population into a pandas DataFrame, and do the same for the feature attributes summary. Note for all of the `.csv` data files in this project: they're semicolon (`;`) delimited, so you'll need an additional argument in your [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) call to read in the data properly. Also, considering the size of the main dataset, it may take some time for it to load completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the dataset is loaded, it's recommended that you take a little bit of time just browsing the general structure of the dataset and feature summary file. You'll be getting deep into the innards of the cleaning in the first major step of the project, so gaining some general familiarity can help you get your bearings."

Make sure that you fill in the **Discussion** cell with your findings and decisions at the end of each step that has one!\n",

While the file encodes this as a list (e.g. `[-1,0]`), this will get read in as a string object. You'll need to do a little bit of parsing to make use of it to identify and clean the data. Convert data that matches a 'missing' or 'unknown' value code into a numpy NaN value. You might want to see how much data takes on a 'missing' or 'unknown' code, and how much data is naturally missing, as a point of interest.\n",

If the distributions of non-missing features look similar between the data with many missing values and the data with few or no missing values, then we could argue that simply dropping those points from the analysis won't present a major issue. On the other hand, if the data with many missing values looks very different from the data with few or no missing values, then we should make a note on those data as special.
